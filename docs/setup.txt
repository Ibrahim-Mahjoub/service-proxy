This document is an overview of the setup procedure for the service-proxy application.

 * Overview *
 This application runs on python 3.7.4

 * Settings  *
 To configure project settings, create a local_settings.py file in the main app folder (service_proxy) and override any settings.

 * Logging *
 NOTE: Logging uses django's logging features which are configured in the project's settings.py file.

 If your webserver is running with a user that does not have file creation and write access to the project directory:  
     1. create the log files manually in the absolute path specified in settings.py
     2. create a group and add the webserver user (apache's is www-data) to that group
     3. make it the default group for the log files
