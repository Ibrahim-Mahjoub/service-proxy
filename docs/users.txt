This document is an overview of service-proxy's user features.

 * Overview *
 Service proxy does not utilize a user model.

 * SPUser * (users: models.py)
 A custom user model which inherits from django's default user model.

 NOTE: SPUser is not implemented as it has no use in the current setup, but allows for future customization of the django user model.
